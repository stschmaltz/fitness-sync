# Fitness Sync

Fitness Sync is a Go-based project aimed at syncing fitness data from Fitbit to Strava. This project is was inspired because I wanted to learn Go!

Fitbit will automatically sync any gps based activities to Strava, but it does not sync any other activities. This project aims to fill that gap and teach me a new language in the process.

## Planned Features

- Ability to sync activities from Fitbit to Strava.
- Ability to specify which activities to sync
- Ability to specify a date range to sync activities
- 

**Note:** This project is a learning exercise in Go, so the code and structure may evolve as I continue to learn and implement new features.
